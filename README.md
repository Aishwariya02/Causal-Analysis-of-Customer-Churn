# Causal-Analysis-of-Customer-Churn

 This project focuses on implementing advanced techniques for analyzing and
 predicting customer churn in business contexts. The project aims to address
 the challenges of acquiring and retaining customers by leveraging
 technologies such as deep feedforward neural networks, sequential pattern
 mining, andcausal Bayesian networks. Evaluation of the implemented models
 will be conducted to assess their performance against existing methods, with
 the aimofdemonstratingsuperior predictive capabilities. Overall, the project
 seeks to translate the findings of the abstract into practical solutions that can
 drive tangible improvements in customer retention e orts
